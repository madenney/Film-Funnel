# Film Funnel

## Overview

> This was a project that I worked on with a team of two other developers during another two day hackathon. The purpose
of the hackathon was to use three different APIs in a single site. We chose to use the Open Movie Database API, the 
Reddit API, and the Youtube API to make a site that gives you the "internet's opinion" on any given movie. My part of
the project was to get Reddit movie reviews, which I did by searching searching for threads containing relevant
movie discussions and extracting comments that contain meaningful reviews. I was also responsible for general code
management and combining everyone's pieces together. It was a good learning experience and I really enjoyed working 
with the team.

# Future

> If I was to come back to this and work on it again, there are several changes I would make. 
- Improve the logic for finding Reddit reviews. Sometimes it pulls from the wrong sources.
- Style the review page better. The youtube section needs work.
